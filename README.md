# TurnoverTrain
In this repository is the final 2021 Big Data Bowl submission for the Turnover Train (Max Bolger, Michael Egle, and Conor McQuiston). There are three major files in the repository:

# tCPOE_calcs.Rmd
This is the file used to create the Targeted Completion Percentage Over Expectation for each player. It creates the secondary.csv file, which contains the tCPOE value for each player with at least 20 targets in the 2018 season. This minimum target number can easily be altered in the code. This file and the db_sep.R file can be run in either order.
